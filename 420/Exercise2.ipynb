    "There are many different kinds of data to be managed and analyzed today, and there are many ways to do it using Python.   Being able to manage and modify data isn't useful unless you can also get data into Python, and save your results from it.   Beginning with this session we're going to review techniques for input and output from Python starting with the simplest file formats and some basic Python tools.  We'll also take a first look at the pandas package.  Pandas has become very popular amongst “Pythonic” data scientists and is being used at the largest of the big data firms.  In the sessions that follow we'll consider more complicated file types and data “munging” tools and techniques.\n",
