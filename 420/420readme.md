Behind every analytics project is an analytical data source. In this course, students explore the fundamentals of data management and data preparation. Students acquire hands-on experience with various data file formats, working with quantitative data and text, relational database systems, and document database systems. They access, organize, clean, prepare, transform, and explore data, using database shells, query and scripting languages, and analytical software. This is a case-study and project-based course with a strong programming component.
