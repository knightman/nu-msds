Math for Data Scientists

## Summary

This contains a selection of public-facing resources, content and code for the PREDICT 400 course.

Information about the program can be found [here](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/program-courses.php?course_id=4761).

## Description

Students learn techniques for building and interpreting mathematical models of real-world phenomena in and across multiple disciplines, including linear algebra, discrete mathematics, probability, and calculus, with an emphasis on applications in data science and data engineering. This is for students who want a firm understanding or review of these fields of mathematics prior to enrolling in courses that assume understanding of mathematical concepts.
