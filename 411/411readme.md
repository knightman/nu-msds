## Description

This course extends linear ordinary least-squares regression, introducing the concept of the generalized linear model and its use in making predictions. The course reviews traditional linear regression as a special case of generalized linear models, and then continues with logistic regression, Poisson regression, and survival analysis. The course is heavily weighted towards practical application with large data sets containing missing values and outliers. It addresses issues of data preparation, model development, validation, and deployment.
